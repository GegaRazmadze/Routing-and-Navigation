# Angular Routing

<p>In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page. As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different <a href="https://angular.io/guide/glossary#view">views</a> that you have defined.</p>
<p>To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular <a href="https://angular.io/api/router/Router">**Router**</a>. The Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.</p>

# RoutingAndNavigation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
